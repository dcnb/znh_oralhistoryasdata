2729,Zora Neale Hurston,"My name is Zora Neal Hurston. I was born in Eatonville, FLorida. I'm 35 years old. This song that I'm going to sing is a railroad song that I found on a railroad gang near Miami and was song to me by Max Ford.",Zora Neale Hurston
2749,Herbert Halpert,How long ago was that?,Herbert Halpert
2751,Zora Neale Hurston,That was in 1930.,Zora Neale Hurston
2755,Herbert Halpert,How did you happen to be going around getting songs?,Herbert Halpert
2758,Zora Neale Hurston,"I was collecting folk material for Columbia University as part of the Barnard College, Columbia University.",Zora Neale Hurston
2765,Herbert Halpert,What is the song called?,Herbert Halpert
2767,Zora Neale Hurston,They call it Gonna see my long-haired babe and it's a railroad spiking song and the rhythm is kept with a spike and a hammer.,Zora Neale Hurston
2777,Herbert Halpert,"Will you try to emphasize, give me the approximate rhythm of the hammer with the stick by hitting it against that?",Herbert Halpert
2782,Zora Neale Hurston,"Yes, sir.",Zora Neale Hurston
2883,Zora Neale Hurston,"Let them hammers ring, boy.",Zora Neale Hurston
2888,Herbert Halpert,"I see you, you seem to be hitting down twice for a hammer. Why is that?",Herbert Halpert
2894,Zora Neale Hurston,"Uh, the men face each other with hammers and they call on each other; they're breasted, they stand breast to breast and one comes down and the other one comes down.",Zora Neale Hurston
2903,Herbert Halpert,Immediately afterwards?,Herbert Halpert
2904,Zora Neale Hurston,"Yes, one comes down [strike, strike]",Zora Neale Hurston
2907,Herbert Halpert,"I see [strike, strike] and how long is that between the double strikes?",Herbert Halpert
2912,Zora Neale Hurston,"The minute that one goes down, the other is on the upstroke and comes right down behind it.",Zora Neale Hurston
2916,Herbert Halpert,And who does the singing?,Herbert Halpert
2918,Zora Neale Hurston,They sing in line. It's a man who doesn't work at all. And he walks up and down and gives the rhythm for the people to work.,Zora Neale Hurston
2925,Herbert Halpert,Is this for a whole crew of men?,Herbert Halpert
2927,Zora Neale Hurston,A whole crew of men singing this one time and the railroad has to pay the singing liner or else the men won't work.,Zora Neale Hurston
2935,Herbert Halpert,What I'm asking you is if you hear that you only hear the one man singing on a whole section of track.,Herbert Halpert
2941,Zora Neale Hurston,"Not all the time, because different ones have verses they want to put in themselves and so they jump in and after they start the song but the singing liner always starts it.",Zora Neale Hurston
2949,Herbert Halpert,"Well now look, uh, the only thing is that you were giving a long piece of singing without the rhythm of the hammer and I want to know approximately how often that comes.",Herbert Halpert
2958,Zora Neale Hurston,"Well, they often do that and then after that they [distortion] get in there but they [distortion]",Zora Neale Hurston
2974,Herbert Halpert,[inaudible],Herbert Halpert
2977,Zora Neale Hurston,"Uh, this song I got in Callahan, Florida, which is a railroad center in the northern part of Florida.",Zora Neale Hurston
2986,Herbert Halpert,Inaudible.,Herbert Halpert
2988,Zora Neale Hurston,I got this in 1935. I don't remember the man's name who sung it to me but I got it at Callahan. It's a railroad camp.,Zora Neale Hurston
2997,Herbert Halpert,What kind of song is it?,Herbert Halpert
2998,Zora Neale Hurston,"This is not exactly a song. It's a chant for the men lining. You know a railroad rail weighs 900 pounds and the men have to take these lining bars and get it in shape to spike it down. And while they're doing that why they have a chant that, uh, and also some songs that they be used to, the rhythm to work it into place and then the boss hollers 'Bring 'em a hammer gang' and they start to spike it down. And this is a chant for lining the rail.",Zora Neale Hurston
3051,Herbert Halpert,"I'd like you to do that again. But this time, when they have . . . What do they call the irons they use?",Herbert Halpert
3056,Zora Neale Hurston,They call it a lining bar.,Zora Neale Hurston
3057,Herbert Halpert,Alright. The lining bar. When they work but don't you hear the clink of it?,Herbert Halpert
3062,Zora Neale Hurston,It's a 'hah'! Now you don't hear the lining bar because it's under the rail and they shove the rail with it.,Zora Neale Hurston
3068,Herbert Halpert,They hit against it?,Herbert Halpert
3068,Zora Neale Hurston,"No, it's under it. You see, it's just like on this. It's a crow bar.",Zora Neale Hurston
3073,Herbert Halpert,"Because over in Mississippi, they showed me by hitting the thing. They said that the way that they did it was by several men taking a short hit.",Herbert Halpert
3081,Zora Neale Hurston,"Well, I've seen them put it between their legs this way and put it back and they get this, this splange under the rail, and then they 'heh, heh'. You know, like that.",Zora Neale Hurston
3090,Herbert Halpert,"Well, now what do they do? Are they pulling it, pulling it --",Herbert Halpert
3093,Zora Neale Hurston,"Pulling it backwards, they're moving it backwards.",Zora Neale Hurston
3094,Herbert Halpert,"In other words, they have it underneath and they're using the lever to go forward.",Herbert Halpert
3098,Zora Neale Hurston,That's right. Yes.,Zora Neale Hurston
3099,Herbert Halpert,Alright.,Herbert Halpert
3100,Zora Neale Hurston,"And all the men, you know because it's always straining and they 'heh'.",Zora Neale Hurston
3103,Herbert Halpert,About how many are there on a bar?,Herbert Halpert
3104,Herbert Halpert,"Oh, some time it's about 7 or 8 on at one time.",Herbert Halpert
3109,Herbert Halpert,"Hmhm. Well, I suppose you try it and you sing it over again.",Herbert Halpert
3112,Zora Neale Hurston,Alright,Zora Neale Hurston
3113,Herbert Halpert,Or chant it.,Herbert Halpert
3143,Zora Neale Hurston,I got 'That Old Black Gal' is a spiking song that I got down there in Miami and was song by Max Ford the singing liner on this construction crew.,Zora Neale Hurston
3153,Herbert Halpert,What's it used for?,Herbert Halpert
3154,Zora Neale Hurston,Used for spiking down the rails.,Zora Neale Hurston
3231,Zora Neale Hurston,"This song they called 'Shove it Over' and it's the lining rhythm pretty generally distributed all over Florida. It was sung to me by Charlie Jones on a railroad construction camp in Lakeland, Florida.",Zora Neale Hurston
3244,Herbert Halpert,About how long ago?,Herbert Halpert
3245,Zora Neale Hurston,"Uh, I gathered that in '33, 1933.",Zora Neale Hurston
3360,Herbert Halpert,This is again for lining?,Herbert Halpert
3362,Zora Neale Hurston,This is a lining rhythm.,Zora Neale Hurston
3363,Herbert Halpert,Now where is the movement?,Herbert Halpert
3366,Zora Neale Hurston,When they say Shacka-lacka-lacka like they are getting ready to pull back and when they say 'heh' they shove the rail over.,Zora Neale Hurston
3371,Herbert Halpert,"In other words, this song gives them quite a lot of rest in between.",Herbert Halpert
3375,Zora Neale Hurston,Right a lot of rest in between.,Zora Neale Hurston
3377,Herbert Halpert,And a harder shove?,Herbert Halpert
3377,Zora Neale Hurston,"And a harder shove at the end. And they say 'heh', they all go.",Zora Neale Hurston
3380,Herbert Halpert,"It seems to have had a different effect from the other lining one you gave, I mean that one about Mobile.",Herbert Halpert
3385,Zora Neale Hurston,"Yes, but someone was short and someone only just come to the mood of the liner. And the men work whatever song he sung, they work that rhythm.",Zora Neale Hurston
3396,Zora Neale Hurston,"Uh, now when the men are lining, they put the rail down, and then of course the captain, he's crouched straddle of it and uh, looks down it so he can tell when it's lined up in exact line with the others. And if they carry it, well he'll say shove it over and if they carry it too far, he'll say send it back and when they get it exactly in line, he'll tell em 'join it ahead' but then they corrupted that to 'join ahead' and all of them say 'join ahead' for 'join it ahead'. And, uh, so, uh, this song is about a lining and the rhythm goes with, they put this lining bar, this long steel bar, crow bar, between their legs so they have greater purchase and pull back on it.",Zora Neale Hurston
3439,Herbert Halpert,"Well, wait a minute. They pull back . . . and how are they facing in relation to the rail.",Herbert Halpert
3442,Zora Neale Hurston,Their back is to the rail.,Zora Neale Hurston
3444,Herbert Halpert,"In other words, they're pulling up on the bar.",Herbert Halpert
3447,Zora Neale Hurston,They're pulling up on the bar. They don't have to look at the rail because that's the captain's job to see when it's right.,Zora Neale Hurston
3452,Herbert Halpert,"Well, what do they do? Do they, how do they get it under the bar, the rail?",Herbert Halpert
3456,Zora Neale Hurston,They just push the flange of this lining bar under the rail and then pull back on it.,Zora Neale Hurston
3460,Herbert Halpert,Do they have to look back at it or do they just feel it?,Herbert Halpert
3463,Zora Neale Hurston,"Oh, they can just feel it. Sometimes they look back, you know, but most of them, they just can feel it and they send it back on there.",Zora Neale Hurston
3470,Herbert Halpert,"Well, uh, you were saying, you were explaining that there's different rhythms that they have. Are there any particular times when a faster on or a slower one would be used?",Herbert Halpert
3480,Zora Neale Hurston,"Well, it's different; it's not any particular time except just the feeling of the singing liner. Whatever song he starts. If it's a fast rhythm they work fast; if its's a slow one, well they work, you know, a little slower but they get just as much work done, it seems, somehow or another.",Zora Neale Hurston
3508,Zora Neale Hurston,ZNH singing low.,Zora Neale Hurston
3510,Herbert Halpert,Alright.,Herbert Halpert
3511,Zora Neale Hurston,"Alright, this song I'm going to sing is a lining rhythm and I'm going to call it Mule on the Mount though you can start with any verse you want and give it a name and it's the most widely distributed work song in the United States and it has innumerable verses and whatnot about everything under the sun and it's a lining rhythm though they sometimes sing it just [cut off].",Zora Neale Hurston
