00:22:45,Herbert Halpert,"Thank you, Mr. Pages [distortion].",Herbert Halpert
00:22:51,Art Pages,"Uh, the song that you have just heard Carlos Poz sing, it's sort of a negro song. It is a negro telling his girl not to mix with another, uh, tribe, because he does not consider them as good as they are and does not want to, uh,  mix the tribes. And --",Art Pages
00:23:13,Herbert Halpert,What do you mean by mix the tribes?,Herbert Halpert
00:23:14,Art Pages,"Well, he does that, it seems like the, uh, girl is in love with someone and she, uh, goes to a nearby tribe and he does not want her to continue to go over there and he is asking her to please stay in her, in their grounds.",Art Pages
00:23:28,Herbert Halpert,He doesn't want to have children from the other tribe.,Herbert Halpert

00:26:50,Herbert Halpert,Alright.,Herbert Halpert
00:26:51,Art Pages,"The idea of the song is uh, the name of the song is 'Merce' and that's a, uh, name, a proper name. It's a negro girl's name and she is supposed to be the most popular of the party and the song refers to her popularity, that is her way of dancing and acting and speaking and so forth and everybody sings to her beauty and her pep, would you say?
